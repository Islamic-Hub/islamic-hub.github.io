We have an official wiki which is hosted by a **third party service** called Miraheze for free. You can visit the wiki by clicking [here](https://islam.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page). We do not have control over:
 * When the wiki is online, offline or when it is available and can be connected to
 * Server maintenance
 * Content submitted by other users (however we can take some actions against this)
 * And the activity of the wiki (it is official however it is sometimes inactive)
A backup wiki is hosted [here](https://islamipedia.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page) as well.
